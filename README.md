# Fraction-Class
Group of classes which treat a fraction as a unique object in Java and has method associated with them to do operations.

The following program/class does not have a main method, but it holds all the descriptions for the Fraction object. It is called and invoked by the main method. To declare a new fraction object, the main method in the other class has to pass it into two integers. This class takes those two integers and constructs a fraction. This Fraction constructor class also holds many methods for operations with fractions (addition, multiplication). This class also has methods for checking equality and inequality (greater than and less than). Lastly, this Fraction class takes care of always reducing the fraction and it takes care of negatives (only numerators can have negatives and cancelling the negative sign when both are negative).
